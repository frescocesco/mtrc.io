					<p>The sculpture, found a few years ago during the excavation of the curia of the forum of Carthago Nova, is bigger than life-size, was carved from a single block of white marble from Carrara. It depicts a larger than normal male figure dressed in a tunic with a toga raised over his head.<br><br>The attention of the sculptor was focused on the clothing, trying to depict the way of wearing a toga, with a first twist around the waist at the balteus and then at the sinus on the chest. His feet are wrapped by the alutae, the calcei patricii, typical footwear of persons of high social standing. Only the front of the piece is carved and it must have been placed in an alcove, since the back of the sculpture is flat and barely outlined.<br><br>The image reproduced by the sculpture is very similar to that of Augustus from the Via Labicana, which was often used, particularly at the start of the Imperial period, to represent the Emperor as the Pontifex Maximus.</p>

During the middle of the 14th century, the Muslims mudejars in Valencia developed an innovative technique for the application of glazes which allowed the start of mass production of high quality china for everyday use.<br><br>This piece belongs to an early production, showing influence of the green and manganese china developed in the same workshops some decades before.</p>

					<p>Relief of extraordinary quality, cut from Luni marble, which represents a female figure with a naked torso sitting on a rock.<br>The head, both arms, which would have been raised upwards, and the left foot are completely missing.<br> The cloak which covers the back is blown open by the wind, creating a succession of folds both sides of the breasts, and is retained by a belt around the waist.<br><br>The theme which is represented here centres on the episode of the encounter between the vestal Rea Silvia, daughter of Eneas and the God Mars, fruit of which would lead to the births of Romulo and Remo. The iconography which describes the aforementioned episode (Ovidio, Fasti, III, 11-45) was developed in the Augustan Age and reproduced in temples and other prestigious monuments, in line with the policy of revival of the old myths about the founding of Rome.</p>

					<p>The horn, made of green glass, was decorated through the application of hot strands of white glass, which spiral around the outer surface of the horn and form the upper motif of spirals.<br><br>These characteristics suggest it derives from traditions from the Germanic region, although its presence in Italy and now in Cartagena can be interpreted as the result of emigration by the Lombards and the adaptation of local craftsmen to their demand.</p>

In this case, it is a medium-sized container with a pointed, ridged body, finished by a small cylindrical foot and base.

The base has two stamps from the Fábrica de La Amistad (Cartagena).<br><br>Created by Tomás Valarino in 1842, the Fábrica de la Amistad used new techniques to make industrial china that were developed at the end of the 18th century, used to produce a series of dinner plates using moulds and decorated using stamps made from original designs. It closed down in 1893.</p>

Only the top third part remains conserved, which includes the epigraph area, cymatium and the lateral pulvini decorated with interwoven leaves and small Gorgon heads. <br><br>The altar forms part of the ideological and iconographic program developed in the Cartagena theatre in order to influence the public promotion of Augustus's young heirs. <br><br>The inscription includes the political career cursus honorum of the youth: in the year 6 B.C. he was appointed pontifex (pontiff) and elected for the consulate in 5 B.C., carrying out magistracy functions in the year 1 A.D. and being appointed as imperator (emperor) in the year 3. <br> <br> The dedicator, Lucius Iunius Paetus, the same one who also appears in the Fortuna altar, was a distinguished representative of the local elite who also is likely to have participated in the financing of the construction of the theatre. <br><br><br>

					<p>These pieces have been unaltered over the centuries thanks to their form, which is identical to modern-day dice. Each face displays a number through a number of circular dots, with the total of the opposite faces always totalling seven. <br> <br>Their use in table games and, above all, betting of Money has been widely documented in written sources, as well as the laws intended to regulate and prevent such use.

					<p>The eagle, emblem of Jupiter, is depicted here as a majestic form, locking its powerful talons on a rocky peak, facing forwards with wings spread out and head tilted towards the left. It is accompanied by a female entourage interpreted as the Muses, which makes a clear reference to Apollo and the scenic arts.<br><br>
The owl, emblem of the goddess Minerva, is represented with its head facing forwards and its body, with wings tucked in at the sides, turned towards the right. The female group which accompanies it can be represented as the Gracias (Graces) or the Charites. Their significance in the theatre could be associated with the idea of prosperity for the city.<br><br>

The peacock, symbol of Juno, advances to the right while turning its head towards the other side, hence bestowing the scene with more volume and movement. <br>The exquisite detail in the depiction of the tail feathers which fall softly to the ground stands out in the carving of the figure. Likewise it is also accompanied by a group of three young girls who are interpreted as the Hours, which could, in the case of our theatre, signify an implicit acknowledgment of the Pax Augusta (Roman peace).

					<p>From the Augustan Age, the theatre, along with the forum, transformed itself into a privileged space for the self-advocacy of the local elite and the proclamation of the slogans and messages originating from the Imperial House. <br> The commemorative lintels of the Cartagena theatre dedicated to Lucius and Caius Caesar constitute a monolithic representation of Augustus's plans for his successors.					<br><br> Caius and Lucius were sons of M. Vipsanio Agrippa, patronus of Carthago Nova and Julia la Mayor, and consequently grandsons of the emperor, very soon being adopted by Augustus who regarded them as his future heirs. 
						<br> <br> The two youths became the objects of an early ennoblement after the death of their father in the year 12 B.C., consequently converting them into Augustus¿s actual successors in the year 6 B.C.

For the quality of its reliefs are considered to be the work of any of the neoáticos workshops set up in Rome in the late first century B.C. <br><br>Other messages may discern in the room with the contemplation of the sculpture of Apollo I Citaredo, protector god of the performing arts, but also revered by Augustus, become their protector god after the victory of Actium in 31 BC, or the relief of a reclining female figure we have interpreted as Rea Silvia, whose iconography was widely promoted by the emperor in his monumental architecture.<br><br>As in other Roman cities also they participated in funding members of the most prominent families of the city, among which include L. Iunius Paetus, who dedicated an altar in honor of Gaius Caesar and another Fortune of the emperor, and Postumii , who dedicated a pedestal Lucius Caesar. <br> The contemplation of these pieces allows visitors to understand the keys of the patronage and political promotion in ancient times, whose contents are expanded in the interactive room.</p>
